    "PyPSA stands for **Python for Power System Analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPSA is an open source Python package for simulating and optimising modern energy systems that include features such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- conventional generators with unit commitment (ramp-up, ramp-down, start-up, shut-down),\n",
    "- time-varying wind and solar generation,\n",
    "- energy storage with efficiency losses and inflow/spillage for hydroelectricity\n",
    "- coupling to other energy sectors (electricity, transport, heat, industry),\n",
    "- conversion between energy carriers (e.g. electricity to hydrogen),\n",
    "- transmission networks (AC, DC, other fuels)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPSA can be used for a variety of problem types (e.g. electricity market modelling, long-term investment planning, transmission network expansion planning), and is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.\n",

    "Compared to building power system by hand in `linopy`, PyPSA does the following things for you:\n",

    "- manage data inputs\n",

    "- `pandas` for storing data about network components and time series\n",

    "> The `plotly.express` module (usually imported as px) contains functions that can create entire figures at once. Plotly Express is a built-in part of the `plotly` library, and is the recommended starting point for creating most common figures. Every Plotly Express function uses graph objects internally and returns a plotly.graph_objects.Figure instance. Throughout the plotly documentation, you will find the Plotly Express way of building figures at the top of any applicable page, followed by a section on how to use graph objects to build similar figures. Any figure created in a single function call with Plotly Express could be created using graph objects alone, but with between 5 and 100 times more code.\n",
