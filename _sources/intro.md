# Open-TYNDP Workshops

Welcome to the website covering a series of hands-on workshops facilitated by Open Energy Transition (OET) to accompany the development of an open-source energy modeling tool for the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP).
With every workshop a new notebook will be added to this website investigating different functionalities of PyPSA and implementations for the Open-TYNDP workflow.

The workshops will, one by one, introduce modellers to the basics of the PyPSA framework and investigate important features of the TYNDP Scenario Building introduced by the OET team.
Notably, this will include workshops on:

- Electricity and H2 reference grids
- Offshore hubs
- Demand profiles
- Existing supply infrastructure (PEMMDB) & climate data (PECD)
- EVs, Synthetic fuels & Hybrid Heat Pumps

## Setting up the environment

### For the workshop: Google Colab

For these workshops we will cover the material without a local Python installation using the online service  [Google Colab (colab.google)](https://colab.google) which provides an online Python version
in a [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.org/) environment. This requires a Google account. For registered workshop participants these will be provided by OET.

For running the notebook using Google Colab you can simply launch it by clicking on the little rocket symbol in the top right corner of the page:

### Alternative: Local installation

#### Installing the package manager `conda`

If you don't want to use Google Colab you will need to install the packages locally. For running this Python and nearly all of the software packages in the scientific python
ecosystem are [open-source](https://opensource.org/). Coordinating the
compatibility between these different packages and their multiple versions can be difficult! Fortunately, the problem is solved by using a Python
_distribution_ and/or _package manager_. You should use a package manager!

#### Anaconda

The easiest way to set up a full-stack scientific Python deployment is to use a
Python distribution. This is an installation of Python with a set of curated
packages which are known to work together.

For instance, you can install on your computer the popular
[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Follow the link above to obtain a one-click installers for your operating system.

For **Linux and MacOS users**, you can access the command line by opening the _terminal_ program.

For **Windows users**, you should first install Anaconda (described above) or `miniconda` (described below), which gives you access to the "Anaconda Prompt" desktop application. (Instructions for this are given on the [Anaconda Website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal).)

From the Anaconda Prompt, you should be able to run `conda` and other shell commands.

#### Lightweight `miniconda`

If you don't want to download a large file like the Anaconda Python Distribution (ca. 800 MB), there is a
lightweight alternative installation called `miniconda`.
Follow the link to the [Miniconda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) page and use, for example, the [quick command line install](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install).

#### Environment for these workshops: `open-tyndp-workshops`

##### ... with `conda` (recommended)

The latest environment specification for this course can be downloaded under the following link as a [`YAML`-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML):

https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp-workshops/blob/main/environment.yaml

There is a download button at the top-right corner.

After navigating to the folder where the `environment.yaml` file is stored ([here](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html)'s a tutorial how to navigate with the command line),
you can create this environment using `conda`

    conda env create -f environment.yaml

Activate this environment

    conda activate open-tyndp-workshops

This environment should be sufficient for all of your work in these workshops.

The environment has to be activated whenever you open a new terminal,
*before* starting a new Jupyter window with

    jupyter lab

##### ... with `pip`

If you want to use `pip` for managing your environment, download

https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp-workshops/blob/main/requirements.txt

There is a download button at the top-right corner.

After navigating to the folder where the `requirements.txt` file is stored,
you can install the required packages with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This should allow you to start a new Jupyter window:

    jupyter lab
