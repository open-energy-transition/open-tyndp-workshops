# Educators Build Your Own Content

This guide helps you in building your own **Data Science for Energy System Modelling** course based on a tailor-made [Jupyter Book][JupyterBook_1]. By following these instructions, you are able to:

* Duplicate the content of this course and use it as your learning material, i.e. lectures, or similar.
* Set up and deploy a static website like this course using [Github Pages action][gh_actions_python]
* Modify this course based on the Jupyter Book [structure][JupyterBook_2].

Before starting, please make sure that you are using the correct python environment that have at least all the python package dependencies from `environment.yaml` or `requirements.txt`. The instruction are [here if you are using conda (reccomended)](../intro.md#with-conda-recommended) and [here if you are using pip](../intro.md#with-pip).

To follow this tutorial, basic usage of Git is a prerequisit. Here are some resources and tutorials to help you get started with Git:

## 1. Create a New Fork

Create your fork of this repository by clicking on the figure below.

In the **Create a new fork** pop-up menu, shown in the figure below, *<ins>deselect</ins>* the default **Copy the `main` branch only** option.

By doing so, you will reduce further branch creation, required by the workflow.

> **Note:** The purpose of this is to retain the initial `gh-pages` branch, which is needed for the next section.

## 2. GitHub Pages Setting

In your fork of this repository, there is a single GitHub Setting that needs modifying:

* In the GitHub repository `https://github.com/<your-username>/data-science-for-esm`, go to the GitHub **Settings** -> **Pages** heading.

* In the **GitHub Pages** heading, go to the **Branch** section, and change the selection from `None` to `gh-pages` `/root`.

Once the branch has been selected, at the top of the page a URL will be provided:
* **Your site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/data-science-for-esm`**.

## 3. Content Modification

Modify the content in your computer by cloning your forked `data-science-for-esm` repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/data-science-for-esm.git
cd ./data-science-for-esm
```

You can modify the content by adding, editing and removing markdown (`.md`) and jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) files in the `data-science-for--esm` folder.
* Make sure that all attachments within the markdown and jupyter notebook are included as well.
* For a successful deployment of the website, please specify the files and order of those file in the [Table Of Contents](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html) `_toc.yml`.
* To modify details of the website, such as the author, logo, other relevant GitHub and Google Collab links, modify the `_config.yml`.

you can test run the changes locally by running the `jupyter-book build data-science-for-esm` command.
* This command is in charge generating the HTML code which you can open from your browser.
* You can then run `jupyter-book clean data-science-for-esm` to remove the generated build.
* Further readings on how `jupyter-book build` works are [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/build.html)

### 3a. Add your own logo

If you want your institution to be placed in the top left corner of this website, we recommend that you follow these steps:
* name your institue logo in as `logo_int.png` and place it inside the data-science-for-esm folder.
* Run `oet-extension/merge_logo.py` to combine your institute with as smaller image of TU Berlin's and OET's logo
* Within `_config.yml`, make sure that the logo is directed to `logo: logo_merged.png`.

## 4. Deploy Settings

In the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`file of the cloned repository, specify the branch other than the `gh-pages`, to be used by the workflow:

~~~
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch
  push:
    branches:
    - main
~~~

Upon the `git push` command to the specified branch, which in this example is the `main` branch, the workflow will be triggered.
~~~
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'new changes applied'
git push
~~~

## 5. GitHub Workflow Deployment

After a successful `git push`, Github will the deploy any workflow within the `.github/workflows/` folder.

The workflow deployment is tracked by your repository's status indicator, in this case a beige-brown dot &nbsp;<strong><b><font color='peru'>‚è∫</font></strong></b>
* This will take minutes to finished, especially for complex python commands in the Jupyter Notebooks.
* Clicking on it will show the running status, and the deployment details.

Upon the deployment finalization, the status indicator turns to:
* successful: a green thick <strong><b><font color='green'>üó∏</font></strong></b>
    * you should be able to see the changes taking place, after some moments, at the specified `https://<your-username>.github.io/data-science-for-esm`
* unsuccessful: a red cross mark <font color="red">üó∂</font>
    * indicating an error in the `_toc.yml`, or one of the content files, which need to be revisited.
